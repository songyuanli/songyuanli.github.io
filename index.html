Songyuan is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science within the Faculty of Environment, Science and Economy at the <b><a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/"> University of Exeter</a></b>, U.K. Fortunately, he is supervised by <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/jh815">Assoc. Prof. Jia Hu</a> and <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/gm321">Prof. Geyong Min</a>.

<br><br>

Before that, Songyuan received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in Computer Science and Technology from the <b><a href="http://www.bupt.edu.cn">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a></b>, China, in 2018 and 2021, respectively. During his Master's journey, he was lucky enough to work with  <a href="http://www.cup.edu.cn/cise/szdw/js2/170715.htm"> Prof. Jiwei Huang</a> and <a href="https://int.bupt.edu.cn/content/content.php?p=6_16_134"> Prof. Bo Cheng</a> at the <b><a href="http://sklnst.bupt.edu.cn/"> State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology</a></b>, Beijing, China.
  
<br><br>

Songyuan's research interests span the areas of <b>distributed systems and networks</b>, <b>services/cloud/edge computing</b>, <b>applied machine learning</b>, and <b>QoS evaluation and optimization</b>. His research results have been published in highly-competitive conferences and journals, including IEEE <i>Transactions on
Cognitive Communications and Networking</i>, IEEE <i>Transactions on Network and Service Management</i>, IEEE <i>ICWS</i>, IEEE <i>SCC</i>, IEEE <i>ISPA</i>. His research is/was supported by EPSRC, EU Horizon, National Natural Science Foundation of China, University of Exeter, etc.

<br><br>

Songyuan's curriculum vitae can be found <a href="/assets/pdf/Songyuan_CV.pdf">here</a>. Feel free to drop him an <a href="mailto:S.Y.Li@exeter.ac.uk">email</a> if you share common interests.

<br>
Over the years, I have worked on  performance modeling and resource management problems of various computing systems, such as web services, cloud data centers, and big data processing systems. My recent focus on distributed machine learning algorithms and  systems leads me to address following exciting research areas and questions.
